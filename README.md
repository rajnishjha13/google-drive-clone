## Why this project exists

- Practice responsive layout and component composition using plain HTML/CSS and Materialize.
- Explore how icons, spacing and visual hierarchy create a modern product-like interface.
- Provide a simple starter template you can fork and adapt for UI experiments.

## Quick preview

Open `index.html` in your browser to preview the layout. The project intentionally uses neutral icons and labels — it is not affiliated with Google (see Disclaimer).

## Features

- Modern responsive header and sidebar layout
- Search input and utility icons in the navigation
- Folder-style cards and simple grid layout for content
- Small, easy-to-read styles in `styles.css` for quick customization

## Run locally (super quick)

From the project root (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
# start a tiny static server and open http://localhost:8000
python -m http.server 8000
```

Or just double-click `index.html` to open it directly in your browser.

## Customize

- Change the navbar label or icon in `index.html`.
- Tweak colors, spacing and layout in `styles.css`.
- Replace Materialize with another CSS framework or remove it entirely for a pure-CSS challenge.

## Learning outcomes you can expect

- Build and structure semantic HTML for a small app shell
- Style a responsive navbar and sidebar layout
- Use Material Icons and a lightweight CSS framework
- Practice spacing, alignment and visual hierarchy

## Contributing

This is a tiny learning repo — contributions are welcome. Typical things to contribute:

- Improve accessibility (aria labels, keyboard navigation)
- Add small UI interactions (vanilla JS) like menu toggles or a mock file viewer
- Provide alternative color themes or a dark mode

To contribute: fork, make a small PR with one focused change, and include screenshots if the change is visual.
